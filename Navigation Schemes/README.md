#Navigation Schemes
Navigation is often times one of the most challenging design problems we face when designing for mobile.  Especially with limited screen real estate, it is imperative to enable users. 

In this review, we will explore some popular and well designed apps from a designers perspective.  There are a lot of really great solutions for navigation so it is hard to explicitly quantify what the "right" answer is.  However, it might be nice to come up with some points on what a good navigation system does in general terms.

Good Navigation: 
*  Users always know "where they are" in the app 
*  Navigation controls dont get in the way of the content
*  Good navigation is efficient

There are really two main classifications of navigation we see in modern apps, but we'll also take a look at some that are definitely some that break the mold.  We'll start with the most common schemes first.

##Tab bars
Tab bars have been a staple in iOS apps since the SDK was first released.


__Pros:__  
*  Tab bars are always visible and always display the current location, as well as all other options for other destinations
*  One-tap to anywhere in the app

__Cons:__  
*  Take up valuable space at the bottom of the screen
*  On screens that scroll-based, user's eyes can be distracted by the bar since new content comes from the bottom
*  If the app also has a navigation bar, the content is squished in a smaller window -- not ideal when the user has to read a lot of text
